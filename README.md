## Who is Nico
Hi there I am Nico Michael
I was Trained by IBM as a Java developer 22 years ago.  
One thing I learned and really liked about working at IBM was the importance given to "Giving back to the Community".
 
In South Africa its called "Ubuntu", that's where Ubuntu Linux got its name from.  

The way I give back to the community is to create reference projects using Industry best practices and publish them in GitHub as Open Source projects in [my repositories](https://github.com/nic0michael) with the hope that other developers will benefit from the knowledge put into these projects.   

## What does Nico do when he is not writing code
I am a Radio Amateur with Unrestricted license : ZS6BVR I experiment with antennas and with Arduino Micro controllers  
  
  


## The RabbitMQProducerMicroservice project

This is a project that covers all best practices in Development, it shows the developer techniques to test code, create integration tests which can be scripted.
The intention here is to benefit both the Junior and Senior Java Developer  

### Building code using TDD
An example of this is the [RabbitMQProducerMicroservice](https://github.com/nic0michael/RabbitMQProducerMicroservice). This is a Teaching project used to teach  developers How to write Code using TDD(Test Driven Development) This verifies the code works according to your design.  
  
### Building code USING BDD to meet Business Requirements  
An even more advanced concept writing Unit tests to verify your code works according to Business Rules provided by Business Annalists in Gherkin format using BDD (Behaviour Driven Design).  

### Testing the Quality of code using SonarQube  
There is a section that show developers how to set-up a SonarQube server and use it to determine the quality of their code    

### Using Postman to Create an Integration Test Suite
This shows developers how to create a scripted test suite that runs in Postman for the Integration Testing of REST API's 

### Using Newman To Automate the Postman Integration Test Suite
This information is published to show developers how to automate the Postman as a Newman Scripted API.

### Producing Docker Containers  
There is also a section showing two ways to "Dockerize" ones project to run as a Docker container and use Portainer to manage ones Docker containers  
  
### A unique Design Pattern for optimizing Spring Boot Micro services
This project features a Micro Service Design Pattern to optimize the Unit Testing [For more information click this link](https://github.com/nic0michael/RabbitMQProducerMicroservice/blob/master/DesignPattern.md)
     
## Commercial Projects
In GitHub we have published  Commercial Projects with Opensource code
I am the architect of Open Source projects in my repositories and worked with other developers and even an ex IBM Senior Architect.
